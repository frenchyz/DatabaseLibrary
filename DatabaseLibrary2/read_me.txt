Project 1 Library

Programs needed:
Mysql,
Mysql Workbench (optional),
Netbeans IDE 8.1

You can load the database with the CadotLibrary.sql file. 
Note that this file also contains functions and store procedures.  
Netbeans needs the mysql connector which is should be already in my lib folder. 
Once the database, the connector, and netbeans are working you can start the GUI through running the 
"GuiLib.java" file. This should start the GUI.
